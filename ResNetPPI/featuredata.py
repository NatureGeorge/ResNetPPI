# Hydrophobic residues and hydrophilic residues were classified according to the ordering of hydrophobicity in the following paper.:
# Miyazawa, S., & Jernigan, R. L. (1996). 
# Residue-residue potentials with a favorable contact pair term 
# and an unfavorable high packing density term, for simulation and threading. 
# Journal of molecular biology, 256(3), 623â€“644.
